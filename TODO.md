To-Do List!

Bass Sax... pull Tuba part if no bass sax?
- This problem probably exists for other parts as well.

- Table schema:
  - Autoscroll has some stuff in it, looks like it could be automated
  - Crop has data for each song it appears, plus info about pages
  - Easily filled in stuff about MetronomeBeatsPerPage if I need it
  - Easily filled in stuff for Layers
  - Recent filled with zeroes
  - ZoomPerPage needs some auto generated stuff


- SetListSong filled with setlist info, will use this for Rehearsal
  - Same for SetList
