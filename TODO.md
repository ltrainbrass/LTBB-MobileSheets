To-Do List!

Bass Sax... pull Tuba part if no bass sax?
- This problem probably exists for other parts as well.

- Table schema:
  - Autoscroll has some stuff in it, looks like it could be automated
  - No idea what Crop is...
  - Defaults has just a bool in it for Initialized
  - Key just has all the keys in it... weird
  - Buncha info in Layers, hope I don't need it
  - Easily filled in stuff about MetronomeBeatsPerPage if I need it
  - Recent filled with zeroes
  - SetListSong filled with setlist info, will use this for Rehearsal
    - Same for SetList
  - Songs
    - What is Sharpen? What is SharpenLevel?
    - How are CreatinoDate and LastModified made? just longs since 1970?
    - Interestingly, SongID is 0
  - SourceType needs some empty stuff
  - ZoomPerPage needs some auto generated stuff
